* Objective
  - To perform the Experiment of the "Representation of Floating Point Numbers and their Arithmetic  " experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/computer-organization-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Representation of Floating Point Numbers and their Arithmetic/Representation of Floating Point Numbers and their Arithmetic_01_Usability_smk.org][Representation of Floating Point Numbers and their Arithmetic_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Experiment link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Experiment page
