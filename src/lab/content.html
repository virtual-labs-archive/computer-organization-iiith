	    Computer science is all about providing <strong>abstractions</strong> and
            their efficient implementation. 
            An abstraction provides a logical view of a certain 
            service or a resource by giving a well-defined 
            black-box model, its associated properties and hides 
            the internal details of the black-box. For example the 
            design and implementation of a processor is abstracted
            away through the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of
            the processor. Further high level programming languages            like C, C++ abstracts away ISA of a processor by allowing
            the programmers to express their intent using language
            constructs like for-loops, while-loops etc. Wherever we use
            abstractions we have to rely on some one for efficient 
            realization of those abstractions. In the case of ISA of 
            a processor, we rely on the processor designer and in the 
            case of high level programming languages we rely on a compiler.	 </p>
	 <p>	
	    In this lab, the first two experiments deal with the two primitive data 
            abstractions, integers and floating point numbers. We look at various approaches
            for representing <strong>integers</strong> and <strong>floating-point </strong>numbers in binary and, their pros and cons.
	    The next four experiments involve writing <strong>assembly language programs</strong> using MIPS and ARM ISA.
            In these experiments we learn how to map high-level language contructs to a sequence of 
            assembly language instructions. In the last experiment of this lab we shall study how to design
            a processor for a subset of MIPS ISA using Single Cycle Per Instruction approach. The idea here
            is that we would like to understand how we can map high level language constructs to assembly
            programs, followed by that how to realize the assembly instructions using logic gates as 
            building blocks.	</p>
	<p>
            Processor, Memory and I/O Devices are three major subsystems in a computer. <strong>Cache memory</strong>            plays major role in bridging the speed mismatch between a processor and the associated
            main memory module. We have three experiments on cache
            memories to illustrate various possible cache organizations and the impact of cache organizations
            on program performance. We have one more experiment illustrating the concept of <strong>Virtual Memory</strong>.	</p>
